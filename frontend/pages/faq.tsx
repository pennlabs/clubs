    <Question title={`What is ${SITE_NAME}?`}>
      {SITE_NAME} is meant to be your central source of information about
      {OBJECT_NAME_LONG_PLURAL} at the {SCHOOL_NAME}. Keep discovering new{' '}
      {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} throughout the year, not just at{' '}
      {data.primaryMeeting}.
    </Question>
    <Question title="How can I provide feedback?">
      We’re so excited to let everyone at the {SCHOOL_NAME} contribute to the
      development of {SITE_NAME}! Your feedback is incredibly important to us.
      Have any questions or comments? Find any bugs?{' '}
      <a href={FEEDBACK_URL}>Please let us know on our feedback form.</a>

    <Question title="Why do I have to log in?">
      Logging in allows us to create an account for you on {SITE_NAME}. This
      gives you access to many useful and upcoming features! When you bookmark a{' '}
      {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR}, it will be saved to your bookmarked list. You can
      use this to keep track of {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} you’re interested in, or a
      part of. You can also be invited to join {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR} member
      lists. Finally, you'll need to log in if you want to use your
      administrator permissions to edit a {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR} page.
    </Question>
    <Question title="How do I use this site?">
      The #1 way to use this site is to browse {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} at the{' '}
      {SCHOOL_NAME}! You can:
      <UnorderedList>
        <li>
          Search for {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} by name, and use filters like Tags
          (tags that describe the club), Size (number of members), and
          Application (if applications are required to join)
        </li>
        <li>Bookmark {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} to keep track of them</li>
        <li>
          Browse information that {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} post: description, how to
          get involved or services that are offered, student experiences
        </li>
      </UnorderedList>
      <br />
      If you run a {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR}, make sure your {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR}{' '}
      has a page on {SITE_NAME}! This lets other students find out about your
      organization and how to get involved.
    </Question>
    <Question title="How do I edit an organization’s profile?">
      You’ll need to have administrator permission for that organization. We’ve
      invited people as administrators based on information submitted by{' '}
      {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} to {data.originalDataSource}.
      <UnorderedList>
        <li>
          If you did not receive administrator permission and you believe you
          should have, let us know at <Contact /> and we will work with you to
          verify your request.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR} did not submit this information
          previously, we've been contacting {OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} by their listed
          email to ask for the names of people who need administrator
          permission. You can also email us at <Contact /> and we will work with
          you to verify your request.
        </li>
      </UnorderedList>
      <br />
      Note that there are 2 levels of administrators: Officers and Owners.
      Officers are able to edit the page, invite other members, and grant
      administrator permissions. In addition to those abilities, Owners are able
      to deactivate or delete the {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR} page.
    </Question>
    <Question title={`Why I can't find an organization on ${SITE_NAME}?`}>
      Sorry about that! We’re in the process of making {SITE_NAME} as
      comprehensive as possible, creating the first complete directory of{' '}

      <UnorderedList>
        <li>
          If you're an administrator of a {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR} and it{' '}

        <li>

          access for your {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR}.

        <li>
          Otherwise, if you're not the administrator of the{' '}

    <Question
      title={`Who is responsible for approving ${OBJECT_NAME_PLURAL} on ${SITE_NAME}?`}

      comply with university guidelines. When your {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR}{' '}

      by the {APPROVAL_AUTHORITY}. You will be notified when your{' '}
      {OBJECT_NAME_SINGULAR} has been reviewed.
