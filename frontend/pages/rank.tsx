      Club Recommendation Algorithm
    </Title>
    <StrongText>How are clubs ordered?</StrongText>
    <Text>
      The order that clubs appear on the home page for the default ordering
      method is determined by several criteria. A recommendation algorithm uses
      these criteria to ensure that students receive the best experience when
      browsing for new clubs and that clubs can effectively reach their target
      demographic.
    </Text>
    <StrongText>How does the club recommendation algorithm work?</StrongText>
    <Text>
      The recommendation algorithm uses the following non-targeted criteria to
      determine how to order clubs on the home page. Clubs are ordered by
      points, and then this ordering as adjusted based on personalized data. The
      points obtained from these categories is calculated and saved once per day
      at 4 AM, so make your changes early! The criteria are:
